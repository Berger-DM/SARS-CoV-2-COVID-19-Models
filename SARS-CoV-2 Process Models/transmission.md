The COVID-19 Transmission process (Fig. 3) can start at any point in the infectious period of the disease for an infected person (Start Event: Spread begun). The infected human defines in which form they will spread the virus (Task: Define form of spread). The virus can either be spread through direct spread (person to person), or through indirect spread (fomites), or through airborne spread, or through another undefined form of spread.

If the virus is spread through direct spread, then this direct spread can either be through touching, coughing, sneezing, or exhaling. If the virus is spread through touching, then the infected person touches another person with their virus-covered hands (Task: Touch another person with virus-covered hands), which leads to infected droplets being deposited on the receiver’s hands (Intermediate Message Throwing Event: Infected droplets deposited on receiver’s hand). If the virus is spread through coughing, then the infected human coughs close to another person (Task: Cough close to another person); if the virus is spread through sneezing, then the infected human sneezes close to another person (Task: Sneeze close to another person); if the virus is spread through exhaling, then the infected human exhales close to another person (Task: Exhale close to another person). If the virus is spread through coughing, sneezing, or exhaling, these then lead to infected droplets being launched in the air (Intermediate
Message Throwing Event: Infected droplets launched in the air).
