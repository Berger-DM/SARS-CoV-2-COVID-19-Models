The Symptomatic Manifestation of COVID-19 Disease process starts when a person is infected (*Start Event: Person Infected*). The infection receptor, or infected receptor, then goes through the disease incubation period before manifesting any symptoms (*Intermediate Timer Event: Incubation period*). This period may range from 1 to 14 days in duration, with a mean duration of 5 to 6 days. After that, the disease may initially manifest with different severities (*Task: Determine initial severity of infection*). The initial severity can either be mild, moderate, or severe.

If the severity of the disease is mild, then the infected receptor goes through the mild symptomatic manifestation of the illness (*Task: Manifest Mild illness symptoms*). In the mild symptomatic manifestation of the disease, the infected receptor may develop a range of mild symptoms: dry cough, mild fever, nasal congestion, sore throat, headache, muscle pain, malaise, or other mild symptoms. While manifesting mild symptoms, the infected receptor may experience a worsening of their clinical condition (*Intermediate Boundary Error Event: Clinical Condition Worsened*). If they do, their condition may deteriorate to either severe or critical disease. If it deteriorates to severe disease, the infected receptor goes through the severe symptomatic manifestation of the disease, which is explained later in the process description. If they deteriorate to critical disease, they go through the critical symptomatic manifestation of the disease, which is explained later in the process description. 

If the severity of the disease is moderate, then the infected receptor goes through the moderate symptomatic manifestation of the disease (*Subprocess: Manifest Moderate Illness symptoms*). In the moderate symptomatic manifestation of the disease, the infected receptor may develop a range of moderate symptoms: fever, cough, shortness of breath, tachypnea, or other moderate symptoms. While manifesting moderate symptoms, the infected receptor may experience a worsening of their clinical condition (*Intermediate Boundary Error Event: Clinical Condition Worsened*). If they do, their condition deteriorates to critical disease, and they go through the critical symptomatic manifestation of the disease, which is explained later in the process description. 

After either mild or moderate illness manifests, it may either be fatal to the infected receptor, or not. If it is, the process ends when the person is deceased (*End Event: Person deceased*). If not, they go through the recovery period for mild or moderate cases (*Intermediate Timer Event: Recovery period for mild/moderate cases*), and then the process ends when they are recovered from the infection (*End Event: Person recovered from infection*). 

If the disease symptoms are severe, then the infected receptor goes through the severe manifestation of the disease (*Subprocess: Severe Illness Symptomatic Manifestation*). In the severe symptomatic manifestation of the disease, the infected receptor may develop a range of severe symptoms: severe pneumonia, ARDS, sepsis, septic shock, or other severe symptoms. While manifesting severe symptoms, the infected receptor may experience a worsening of their clinical condition (*Intermediate Boundary Error Event: Clinical Condition Worsened*). If they do, their condition deteriorates to critical disease, and they go through the critical symptomatic manifestation of the disease, which is explained later in the process description.

If the infected receptor deteriorates to critical disease, then they go through the critical symptomatic manifestation of the disease (*Subprocess: Critical Illness Symptomatic Manifestation*). In the critical symptomatic manifestation of the disease, the infected receptor may develop a range of critical symptoms: respiratory failure, RNAemia, cardiac injury, septic shock, Multiple Organ Dysfunction, or other critical symptoms. 

After either severe or critical illness manifests, it may either be fatal to the infected receptor, or not. If it is, the process ends when the person is deceased (*End Event: Person deceased*). If not, they go through the recovery period for severe or critical cases (*Intermediate Timer Event: Recovery period for severe/critical cases*), and then the process ends when they are recovered from the infection (*End Event: Person recovered from infection*).
